Getting and cleaning data course project
===================

Getting and cleaning data is part of the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. 

The aim of this project is to show the user's ability to obtain, transform and clean a data set. The raw data has been obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The details can be found in:

Here is the explanation of the original data as described in their site:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data." 

The original data was separated in different files and contained a great amount of information that wasn't needed. After performing several transformations, we have obtained a tidy data set with the average values of the needed measurement for each subject and activity. 

You can find more information about the different variables and the transformations performed in the CodeBook.md file.
