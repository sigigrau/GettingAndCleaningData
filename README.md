Getting and cleaning data course project
===================

Getting and cleaning data is part of the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. 

The aim of this project is to show the user's ability to obtain, transform and clean a data set. The raw data has been obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The details can be found in:

The original data was separated in different files and contained a great amount of information that wasn't needed. After performing several transformations, we have obtained a tidy data set with the average values of the needed measurement for each subject and activity. 

You can find more information about the different variables and the transformations performed in the CodeBook.md file.
